a cap seller was sleeping under a tree
the monkeys stole his caps
the monkey seller woke up 
he got angry at monkeys
he got very angry at monkeys
 he rembered his grand fathers story
he threw his cap down but the monkeys didnt follow him
the monkeys said "you are not the only one who have a grandfather"
